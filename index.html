                <p class="chicken1"> While the deal is appealing to customers, many of the independent franchisees that own and operate Subway locations pushed 
                ack against the promotion, saying they will lose money with every sandwich they sell. Some Subway franchisees are so infuriated 
                by the deal that they have filed complaints with the Federal Trade Commission, Restaurant Business reports. 75% of franchisees 
                surveyed by Subway North American Association of Subway Franchisees said they would refuse to offer the deal. Make afat to make a

                <p class="Beef1"> When it comes to roast beef, the received wisdom is that it should always be cooked on the bone – whether it's a sirloin 
                joint or rib roast – as the bone both conducts heat and adds flavour. However, this doesn’t suit everyone and some of our most
                popular recipes are bone-free and much easier to carve. Buy what suits you best. More important than the bone is the fat – don’t
                empted to trim it off as it will baste your meat while it cooks. You can always cut it away when you serve it. If you want the
                 fat to make a crust, then you have to sprinkle or rub it with flour and/or mustard powder to absorb the fat released on the 
                 surface.</p>

                 check if the oil is hot enough, drop in 1-inch cube of white bread. The bread should brown in a 40 count. Cut cod into 4 
                 servings, 6 to 8-ounce portions and season with salt and pepper. Place a couple of scoops of flour in a pie tin. Combine egg
